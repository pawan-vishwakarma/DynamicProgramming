# 🧠 Dynamic Programming Mastery Journey 🚀

This repository documents my comprehensive learning and problem-solving journey focused on **Dynamic Programming** — one of the most important and frequently asked concepts in technical interviews.

It includes:
- 📘 **Striver’s Dynamic Programming Series** (All 56 problems)
- 🏯 **AtCoder DP Contest** (26 classic problems)
- 🏁 **Codeforces DP Problems** (hand-picked problems from contests)

---

## ✨ Short Description

> A complete repository of Dynamic Programming problems solved from Striver’s DP Series, AtCoder DP Contest, and Codeforces — covering everything from basics to advanced patterns with clear code, explanations, and documentation. Ideal for anyone preparing for coding interviews or competitive programming.
